# A country has n cities. Initially, there is no road in the country. One day, the king decides to
# construct some roads connecting pairs of cities. Roads can be traversed either way. He wants those
# roads to be constructed in such a way that it is possible to go from each city to any other city
# by traversing at most two roads. You are also given m pairs of cities â€” roads cannot be constructed
# between these pairs of cities. Our task is to construct the minimum number of roads that still satisfy
# the above conditions. The constraints will guarantee that this is always possible.
