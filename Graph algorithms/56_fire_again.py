# After a terrifying forest fire in Berland a forest rebirth program was carried out. Due to it N rows
# with M trees each were planted and the rows were so neat that one could map it on a system of
# coordinates so that the j-th tree in the i-th row would have the coordinates of (i, j). However
# a terrible thing happened and the young forest caught fire. Now we must find the coordinates of the
# tree that will catch fire last to plan evacuation. The burning began in K points simultaneously,
# which means that initially K trees started to burn. Every minute the fire gets from the burning
# trees to the ones that arenâ€™t burning and that the distance from them to the nearest burning tree
# equals to 1. Find the tree that will be the last to start burning. If there are several such trees,
# output any.
