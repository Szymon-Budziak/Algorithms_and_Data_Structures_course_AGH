# ASD_exercises_solutions
This is the repository with solutions from ASD (Algorytmy i Struktury Danych - Algorithms and Data Structures) exercises at AGH. Here I will share all of the codes written by me and codes written during exercises. All codes are written in English but the content of the exercises are written in Polish. Also all codes are written according to the PEP 8 style.

## Licence
If you use this repository/code for classes or for something else, please give me a star or a fork :). It will help me know that my work is important and useful to someone.
