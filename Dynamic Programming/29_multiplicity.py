# We are given an integer array [a1, a2, ..., an]. The array B is called to be a subsequence of A if
# it is possible to remove some elements from A to get B. Array [b1, b2, ..., bk] is called to be good
# if it is not empty and for every i (1 <= i <= k) bi is divisible by i. Find the number of good
# subsequences in a modulo 10^9 + 7. Two subsequences are considered different if index sets of numbers
# included in them are different. That is, the values of the elements do not matter in the comparison
# of subsequences. In particular, the array a has exactly 2^n âˆ’ 1 different subsequences (excluding an
# empty subsequence). Return the number of good subsequences taken modulo 10^9 + 7.
